2.	Write name of the method which is not seen by the child class object

Create two versions:
version 01: without 'using' keyword version 02: with 'using' keyword

Task 13.2 Base class having a virtual and a pure virtual function. Derived class having same copy of virtual function with changed logic and definition of pure virtual function.

Perform following tasks:
1.	Try to call child class overriding method from base class pointer.
2.	Try to call child class definition of pure virtual function in child class.
