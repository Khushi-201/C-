Task-11.1 Inheritance Basics:
WAP in C++ to create a Parent and Child interaction using inheritance. With this Parent and Child Interaction try to perform these tasks:
a.	Call Parent class method in child class function without creating an object of parent class
b.	Call Parent class method in main method by child class object

Task-11.2 Multiple Inheritance in C++:
Create two classes named Mammals and MarineAnimals. Create another class named BlueWhale which inherits both the above classes. Now, create a function in each of these classes which prints "I am mammal", "I am a marine animal" and "I belong to both the categories: Mammals as well as Marine Animals" respectively. Now, create an object for each of the above class and try calling

1	- function of Mammals by the object of Mammal
2	- function of MarineAnimal by the object of MarineAnimal 3 - function of BlueWhale by the object of BlueWhale
4 - function of each of its parent by the object of BlueWhale

Task-11.3 Dimond Problem in multiple inheritance using C++:
a.	WAP to illustrate Dimond Problem in multiple inheritance
b.	its solution using Virtual base classes. Write separate programs if required.
c.	What else multiple inheritance can cause in a program, explain it by providing proper solution
